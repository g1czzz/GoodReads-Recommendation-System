In this project, we are given trained user and book item vectors using a GoodReads dataset. Goodreads is a social cataloging website that allows individuals to search its database of books, annotations, quotes, and reviews. There are multiple types of interactions that a user can have with a book: add books to a list of books they intend to read ("short-list" the book), indicate they have read books before, and review books they have read. A user may have interacted with a book, even if they never left any explicit rating or review. Ratings actually left by users range from 1 to 5 (stars), with 5 being the most positive and 1 being the most negative.
Here, we work with multiple types of data that capture interactions between books and users as training data for a recommendation system. For each "type" of rating data, we are given the raw ratings data, as well as user and item vectors trained using a Python package (https://berkeley-reclab.github.io/) that implements matrix factorization in cases where there are missing entries in a matrix. The "ratings" data is in a "sparse matrix"/dictionary format, meaning that the dictionary keys are of the kind (user, item), and the dictionary value is the corresponding value. Not all pairs are in the matrix, indicating that that value is missing or at its default value.
